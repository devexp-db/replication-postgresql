Prerequisites:  You should have RHEL 6 virtual machines.  Both machines
must be subscribed (available RHEL 6 repositories).  You need to be able
to ssh to root user without password to both of them.

Then, simply run './run MASTER_IP SLAVE_IP'.

This is just toy example of replication, used as debugging example.
Please, consult the 'run' script carefully to what is happening in
background.
