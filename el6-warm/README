Prerequisites:  You should have two RHEL 6 virtual machines, both machines must
be subscribed (available RHEL 6 repositories) and up2date.  Also, machines must
be configured to allow you ssh under root.

Then, simply run './run MASTER_IP SLAVE_IP'.

This is just a toy example of replication, used as debugging example.  Please,
consult the 'run' script carefully to what is happening in background.
